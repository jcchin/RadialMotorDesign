Motor Sizing Program
--------------------
Using OpenMDAO to optimize motor geometry based on given parameters and constraints.

Main Goal:
Create more accurate motor sizing code and then cross-check the results with an optimized motor design.
--------------------

Known Issues (TODO):
- Flux Density calculation is incorrect
	- Research and fix

- Torque calculation is incorrect
	- Research and fix

--------------------


TODO:
- Make connections / promote variables to be used in other calculations

- Comments for equations:
	- Book the equation is from
	- Equation Number
	- Page number?

- V_1
	- Stator Voltage - Same as bus voltage?

- N_1
	- Number of turns per phase - Make sure this is understood

- Power (Electromagnetic)
	- Is it power_in or power_out?  Or neither?
